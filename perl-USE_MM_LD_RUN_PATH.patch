+The Fedora perl MakeMaker distribution differs from the standard
+upstream release in that it disables use of the MakeMaker generated
+LD_RUN_PATH by default, UNLESS this attribute is specified , or the
+USE_MM_LD_RUN_PATH environment variable is set during the MakeMaker run.
+
+The upstream MakeMaker will set the ld(1) environment variable LD_RUN_PATH
+to the concatenation of every -L ld(1) option directory in which a -l ld(1)
+option library is found, which is used as the ld(1) -rpath option if none
+is specified. This means that, if your application builds shared libraries
+and your MakeMaker application links to them, that the absolute paths of the
+libraries in the build tree will be inserted into the RPATH header of all
+MakeMaker generated binaries, and that such binaries will be unable to link
+to these libraries if they do not still reside in the build tree directories
+(unlikely) or in the system library directories (/lib or /usr/lib), regardless
+of any LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting. So if you specified -L../mylib -lmylib , and
+ your 'libmylib.so' gets installed into /some_directory_other_than_usr_lib,
+ your MakeMaker application will be unable to link to it, even if LD_LIBRARY_PATH
+is set to include /some_directory_other_than_usr_lib, because RPATH overrides
+LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
+
+So for Fedora MakeMaker builds LD_RUN_PATH is NOT generated by default for
+every link. You can still use explicit -rpath ld options or the LD_RUN_PATH
+environment variable during the build to generate an RPATH for the binaries.
+
+You can set the USE_MM_LD_RUN_PATH attribute to 1 on the MakeMaker command
+line or in the WriteMakefile arguments to enable generation of LD_RUN_PATH
+for every link command.
+
+USE_MM_LD_RUN_PATH will default to 1 (LD_RUN_PATH will be used) IF the
+$USE_MM_LD_RUN_PATH environment variable is set during a MakeMaker run.
